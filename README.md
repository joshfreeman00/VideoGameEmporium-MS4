### Colour scheme

* The colors of purple and black used throughout help contrast the white text.
 - The two colors also help ease the users eyes. It reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for accessability.
* The white colours of the delivery banner and checkout along with the black text allows the users to see what they are purchasing as both colours have the greatest contrast.

### Fonts 

* The main font used throughout the website is Open Sans. A fullback font of Sans-Serif is used just in case for whatever reason is that the font isn't loaded correctly.
  - The link to link to the font Open Sans can be found [here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans)
